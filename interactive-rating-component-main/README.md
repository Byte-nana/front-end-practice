# üåü Interactive Rating Component ‚Äì _Frontend Mentor Challenge Solution_

This is a solution to the [_Interactive Rating Component challenge on Frontend Mentor_](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).  
It showcases a clean, responsive rating card where users can select a score and receive a dynamic ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù message upon submission.

This project is part of my **Front-End Practice Series**, designed to strengthen DOM manipulation, user interaction handling, and UI accessibility.

## Overview

A minimal yet interactive rating card built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6 modules)**.  
Users can select a rating from 1‚Äì5 and, upon clicking ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, view a dynamically generated thank-you message ‚Äî all within the same card.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** ‚Äì semantic, accessible structure
- **CSS3** ‚Äì gradient background, rounded components, smooth transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6)** ‚Äì event listeners, DOM updates via `innerHTML`

---

## My Process

### Main Features

- Interactive rating buttons (1‚Äì5) with active and hover states
- Dynamic card update showing a thank-you message after submission
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Accessible visual contrast and readable typography

### What I Learned

- How to **handle multiple event listeners** efficiently with **event delegation**.
- Improved logic for **active button state toggling** (`btn--clicked` class).
- Learned how to **replace card content dynamically** using JavaScript without reloading the page.

```js
card.innerHTML = `
  <img class="thank__img" src="./images/illustration-thank-you.svg" alt="Thank you image" />
  <div class="thank__wrapper">
      <p class="thank__score">You selected ${score} out of 5</p>
      <h1 class="title">Thank you!</h1>
      <p class="thank__content content">
          We appreciate your feedback and support.
      </p>
  </div>
`;
```

### Challenges and Problem-Solving

Initially, I debated **whether to build a separate thank-you card component** or modify the existing one dynamically.  
I decided to **change the innerHTML of the main card** instead of creating a separate section because:

- It keeps the structure lightweight and avoids unnecessary duplication in HTML.
- The user interaction feels **instant and seamless** without DOM element toggling or complex state management.
- It improves maintainability ‚Äî all state changes occur in one place (`onSubmit()` function).

This approach also allowed better control of animations and transitions between states.
