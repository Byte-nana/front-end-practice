## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic, accessible structure  
- **CSS3** – responsive layout using Grid/Flexbox and custom properties  
- **JavaScript (optional)** – for interactivity and DOM manipulation  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  
- **Google Fonts** – consistent typography

## 💡 My Process

### Main Features

- Responsive layout with mobile-first approach  
- Interactive hover/touch effects with accessible feedback  
- Clean and scalable design tokens for spacing, colour, and typography  
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions  

### What I Learned

- How to apply **CSS clamp()** for fluid font sizing and spacing  
- Improved understanding of **media queries** and **breakpoint logic**  
- Used **event delegation** and **dataset attributes** for efficient JS interactivity  

### Challenges and Problem-Solving

- Ensured layout consistency across screen sizes by adjusting flex/gap values  
- Managed hover vs. touch interactions using `@media (hover: hover)` and `@media (hover: none)`  
- Refined responsive typography without breaking layout proportions  

### Continued Development

- Explore **container queries** for component-level responsiveness  
- Add **ARIA roles** and **keyboard navigation** for accessibility  
- Convert styles into **component-based structure** (BEM or utility-first CSS)
