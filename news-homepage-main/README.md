## üí° My Process

### Main Features

- Responsive two-column layout with adaptive typography
- Mobile navigation menu with overlay background
- Semantic sectioning for improved readability and accessibility
- Hover and active states for all interactive elements

### What I Learned

- How to structure a **multi-section grid layout** with CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive design.
- Improved my understanding of **clamp()** for scalable font sizing and spacing.
- Used **event delegation** to toggle the mobile menu with efficient DOM control.

```js
function toggleNav(target, className, state) {
  if (target.matches(className)) {
    headerNav.classList[state]('open');
    body.classList[state]('overlay');
  }
}
```

### Challenges and Problem-Solving

The key challenge was managing **the navigation menu toggle** between mobile and desktop views.  
I wanted to avoid repetitive code, so instead of attaching multiple listeners to each icon, I used a single event listener on the header and **delegated actions** based on the clicked target.  
This approach keeps the logic **clean, maintainable, and scalable**, especially if more navigation states are added later.
