## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic, accessible structure
- **CSS3** – modern styling using variables and hover effects

---

## 💡 My Process

### Main Features

- Clean, centred card layout with background pattern
- Adaptive **mobile and desktop** backgrounds using media queries
- Interactive **“Change”** link and button hover states
- Consistent colour system defined with CSS variables

### What I Learned

- How to use **CSS variables** to manage colours and ensure design consistency.
- Practised **mobile-first responsive design**, switching background images dynamically.
- Refined understanding of **visual rhythm** and **padding balance** for readability.

### Challenges and Problem-Solving

One challenge was **ensuring proportional spacing across different screen sizes**.  
To address this, I used the `clamp()` and flexible units approach to keep the design visually stable on all devices.  
Additionally, hover and active button states were carefully adjusted for both **desktop and touch devices** to create a natural user experience.
